- Multi-layer encryption for data protection
- Compression algorithms for minimal data transfer
- SMS fallback for critical notifications

## Implementation Requirements

### Smart Contract Development
- Solidity for Ethereum-based implementation
- Layer-2 solutions for cost-effective operations
- ZKP libraries for privacy-preserving verification
- Light client implementation for mobile devices

### Security Considerations
- HIPAA/GDPR/local regulatory compliance
- Zero-knowledge authentication mechanisms
- Quantum-resistant encryption considerations
- Strict access control enforcement
- Regular security audits
- Data minimization principles
- Secure multi-party computation for sensitive operations

### Integration Points
- Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
- National health databases where available
- Medical device and diagnostic equipment
- Pharmaceutical supply chains
- Public health reporting systems
- NGO healthcare delivery programs
- Satellite and alternative connectivity solutions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Hardhat or Truffle development framework
- Mobile development environment for client applications
- IPFS node (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/remote-healthcare-identity.git

# Install dependencies
cd remote-healthcare-identity
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network testnet
```

### Configuration

Create an environment configuration file with necessary parameters:

```
NETWORK_ID=97
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
IPFS_GATEWAY=your_ipfs_gateway
DEFAULT_CONSENT_EXPIRY=2592000 # 30 days in seconds
EMERGENCY_ACCESS_TIMEOUT=3600 # 1 hour in seconds
HEALTH_AUTHORITY_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Patient Identity

```javascript
const patientIdentity = await PatientIdentity.deployed();
await patientIdentity.createIdentity(
  patientPublicKey,
  biometricHash,
  encryptedBasicInfo,
  emergencyContactHash,
  { from: registrarAccount }
);
```

### Adding a Medical Record

```javascript
const medicalHistory = await MedicalHistory.deployed();
await medicalHistory.addMedicalRecord(
  patientId,
  "CONSULTATION",
  encryptedRecordData,
  recordMetadata,
  ipfsDocumentHash,
  { from: healthcareProviderAccount }
);
```

### Verifying a Healthcare Provider

```javascript
const providerVerification = await ProviderVerification.deployed();
await providerVerification.registerProvider(
  providerPublicKey,
  "PHYSICIAN",
  licenseDetails,
  specializations,
  credentialProofs,
  { from: healthAuthorityAccount }
);
```

### Initiating a Telemedicine Session

```javascript
const telemedicineAuth = await TelemedicineAuthorization.deployed();
await telemedicineAuth.requestConsultation(
  patientId,
  providerId,
  "FOLLOW_UP",
  encryptedConsultationDetails,
  preferredTimeWindow,
  { from: patientAccount }
);
```

## Field Implementation Guide

### Deployment Scenarios
1. **Rural Clinic Network**: Establish local validation nodes at hub clinics with satellite connectivity
2. **Humanitarian Response**: Rapidly deploy identity system during disaster response or refugee health services
